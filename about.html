                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p><i>Super Necklace</i> was founded in August 2020 during an innovation camp hosted by our university. <br> We were given a task to propose an idea for a problem connected to the ongoing pandemic we all have experienced this past year. <br> With this problem we came up with Super Necklace and has since put all our <b>time</b> and <b>energy</b> into this company and product. </p>

                        <h2>Future</h2>
                        <p>It's hard to predict the future of Super Necklace and to decide which direction we would like for the company to take. <br> It's not easy being a startup but we fully believe in our product, and our <b>only wish</b> is for Super Necklace to blossom and grow further, even when this pandemic is under control or gone. <br> We hope you <b>all</b> will follow us on our journey! </p>
